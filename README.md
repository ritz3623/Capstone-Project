"A Developed Country is not a place where poor have cars. It's where the rich use Public Transportation"

According to me if we see the situation of current time in the world, there is a need to have very convenient and affordable transportation services. The Taxi service is one of the most used service all over the world and it is evolved into major and first preferable transportation among the people. Taxi Service specially got the benefits of technologies like (GPS, Smartphone etc.).

This is the actual thought behind my motivation for to find more insights in this area so that we can help in growth of business of Taxi Service. The following ideas which more of a business questions which I would like to address by applying data science skills and hoping to find some interesting patterns.


What dataset I will be considering?

Dataset: NYC - Yellow Taxi Trip Records

<b>Idea 1: Predict the tip amount (percentage value if required) usually driver receives from customers</b>

<b>Description:</b>

•	Usually tip amount is the kind of reward given by customer to driver based on what factors / actions are help to make customer to do so.

•	If we learn or find the patterns behind this then it would be great for drivers as well as company.

•	Company will have set of rules or actionable which are effective in nature and by which they can direct their driver towards a goal of great service provider.

•	If this happened then it will be obvious that there will be increment in the number of drivers joining the company.

<b>Idea 2: Predict that the customer "will dispute" on final bill payment or "will not disput"</b>

<b>Description:</b>

•	Sometime disagreement on final bill payment between customer and driver (company) happens. Here we are trying to find the patterns and various reasons which are involved in such cases.

•	If we found some interesting then company can take a decision towards affordable rate charges which will benefits the customers.
